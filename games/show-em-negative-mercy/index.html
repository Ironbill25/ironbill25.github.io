            <p>Welcome to Uno: Show 'Em Negative Mercy! This version of Uno is based off Uno: Show 'Em No Mercy, but
                with a few changes. <br>
                <small>Stacking cards is allowed in this game!</small>
            </p>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>All original rules from No Mercy apply, but there's also a new rule: <br>
            <strong>Absolutely No Mercy Rule:</strong> Instead of being kicked out when you have 25+ cards, it takes 50 cards! Extra brutal.</p>
            <h3>Cards</h3>
            <p>This game includes all of the cards from Uno: Show 'Em No Mercy, and a few extra:
            <ul class="card-list">
                <li><strong>Wild Draw 16</strong> - The next player must draw 16 cards, or stack another Wild Draw 16.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wild Reverse Draw 4</strong> - Reverses the direction of play, then the next player must
                    draw 4 cards, or stack another draw card.</li>
            </ul></p>
